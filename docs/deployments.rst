Google Colab is a free-to-use hosted Jupyter notebook service that provides
computing resources including GPUs and itkwidgets is now supported in Colab
notebooks! You can get started with a demo notebook:

Or visit the `welcome page`_ to upload your own notebook or create one from scratch.

Notebooks can be uploaded from a repository, Google Drive, or your local machine.


Jupyter Notebook
----------------

To use itkwidgets locally first `install Jupyter Notebook`_ and start Jupyter:

.. _install Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook

.. code-block::

    pip install notebook
    jupyter notebook

If you'd rather interact with remotely hosted notebooks you can also open them
in Binder:
